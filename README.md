# Rock Paper Scissors
This app lets users play against each other in a game of rock paper scissors online. A match will not start until two players are queued for a match. 
Each turn requires both players to pick click any of the rock, paper or scissors image and then the select button. The web server will then return a result to both
players. The player who first reaches 3 wins is declared the winner.

A deployed version of this app can be accessed [here](http://167.71.210.228/)
You can play against yourself by queueing in a incognito browser tab and a normal browser tab at the same time.
